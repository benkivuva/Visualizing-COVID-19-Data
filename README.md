# Visualizing the Spread of COVID-19

Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, the virus spread rapidly across the globe, leading to millions of infections and deaths. In this R project, we will use data visualization techniques to explore the early months of the coronavirus outbreak and understand how it grew to become a global pandemic.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Specifically, we will use the time-series data for confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths at the global level.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to visualize the spread of COVID-19 over time and explore patterns in the data. We will use R packages such as `dplyr` to manipulate data frames and `ggplot2` to create informative and visually appealing plots.

## Requirements

This project assumes you have intermediate R programming skills, including experience with data manipulation using `dplyr` and data visualization using `ggplot2`. You should also have the following packages installed:

- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `tidyr`
- `scales`

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `datasets`: this directory contains the raw data files used in the project.
- `notebook.ipynb` : this is a Jupyter notebook that contains code, visualizations, and documentation.

## Running the Project

To run this project on your own machine, follow these steps:

- Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
- Open the Jupyter notebook file notebook.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run each cell of the notebook in order, either by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or using the "Shift + Enter" keyboard shortcut.
- The notebook will import the data files from the datasets directory and use them to generate visualizations and perform data analysis.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we will gain a better understanding of the spread of COVID-19 over time and the factors that contributed to its rapid expansion across the globe. By visualizing the data using `ggplot2`, we will create compelling and informative graphics that can help us better comprehend the scale of the pandemic.
